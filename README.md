# Stragol  

### Motiviation
Desire of building more complex applications, using python. In order to slowly progress in making more and more structured programs.
Developing has started withing the course 'Scripting language project' at the univeristy. I took that course in 2nd semester.     

## What and why is Stragol
While working in some company, where there are countless number of desks, at most of cases there is a need for fast and comfortable communicating with co-workers without leaving your own place.
Stragol is a chat application focused on productivity, with a minimalistic look. Stragol allows to express yourself as a individual person, avoiding headeache from over-complicated look, which may occur when combaining different personalisties at one place.
